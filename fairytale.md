# Fairytale

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away ...

Five adventurers went on an epic quest.

They found the magic sword, and went on an adventure.

The sword was glowing red.


The sword was definitely not a lightsabre because that would be copyright infringement.

and they lived happily ever after.
"Ouch that's hot," Gotho said.

They also found an axe.

Its blade was sharp, it had a long handle.
It was very beautiful.
Unfortunately the princess wanted the sword pink!


and they lived happily ever after.
"Ouch, that's sharp," Gotho said.

and they lived happily with a cat ever after.

until the fire nation attacked..

The end.
A story written by the workshop attendees of Autumn 2023.
