# Fairytale

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away ...

They found the magic sword, and went on an adventure.

The sword was glowing red.

"Ouch that's hot," Gotho said.

They also found an axe.

Its blade was sharp, it had a long handle.
It was very beautiful.

and they lived happily with a cat ever after.

The end.
