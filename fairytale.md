Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away ...

They found the magic sword, and went on an adventure.

The sword was glowing red.

"Ouch that's hot," Gotho said.

They also found an axe.

Its blade was sharp.
It was very beautiful.

"Ouch, that's sharp," Gotho said.

and they lived happily ever after.

The end.
