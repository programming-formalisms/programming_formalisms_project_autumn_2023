# Fairytale

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away ...

Five adventurers went on an epic quest.

They found the magic sword, and went on an adventure.

The sword was glowing red.

"Ouch that's hot," Gotho said.

They also found an axe.

Its blade was sharp, it had a long handle.
It was very beautiful.

and they lived happily with a cat ever after.

until the fire nation attacked..

The end.
